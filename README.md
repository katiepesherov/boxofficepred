Masters project submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Master of Science in Data Science degree in the College of Aviation, Science, and Technology of Lewis University

[Abstract]
The goal of this project is to analyze the Box Office Dataset and the Rotten Tomatoes Movie Dataset to create a model that can predict the all-time Domestic Box Office sales based on Rotten Tomatoes critics ratings. Prior to movie release in theaters, critics are invited to view the movie and provide reviews on several online and paper forums. In the first step of this analysis, I identified which components are the most influential in predicting Domestic Box Office Sales. Second, I showed that it is possible to build a powerful prediction model using regression. Lastly, I confirmed that the content of criticsâ€™ reviews can positively increase the accuracy of predicting Domestic Box Office Sales.
